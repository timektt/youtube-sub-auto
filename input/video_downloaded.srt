00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
People often think of artificial intelligence as a technical problem.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,839
What can we get the machines to do?

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,080
But the perspective we'll take in this course is that all uses of computers occur in the

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,920
contexts of people and that what we really need to do is design and optimize human computer

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,879
systems, not just technical systems alone.

6
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,519
So we'll give students a sense of and an understanding of how to do that better.
