1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,920
Love and can hurt, Love and can hurt sometimes, but it's the only thing that

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:53,920
I know, when it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes, it is the only thing that makes us feel alive.

3
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:09,920
We keep this love in a photograph, we make these memories for ourselves, where our eyes are never closing, hearts are never broken, times forever frozen still.

4
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:25,920
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans, holding me close until I made you won't ever be alone.

5
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Wait for me to come home. Love and can heal, Love and can mend your soul, and it's the only thing that I know, know.

6
00:01:49,920 --> 00:02:09,920
I swear it will get easier, remember that I put every piece of work in it, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die.

7
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:25,919
We keep this love in a photograph, we make these memories for ourselves, where our eyes are never closing, hearts are never broken, times forever frozen still.

8
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:43,919
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans, holding me close until I made you won't ever be alone.

9
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:59,919
And what you hurt me, that's okay baby, only words complete, inside these pages you just hold me, no one ever let you burn.

10
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:11,919
Wait for me to come home.

11
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:19,919
Wait for me to come home.

12
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:37,919
We can fit, we inside the pocket of your ripped jeans, holding me close until I made you won't ever be alone.

13
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:55,919
And what you hurt me, that's okay baby, only words complete, inside these pages you just hold me, no one ever let you burn.

14
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:10,919
And I'll remember how you kissed me, under the lamppost back on 6th street, hearing you whisper through the phone.

15
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,919
You're at the top of the mountain.

16
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:21,919
Wait for me to come home.
